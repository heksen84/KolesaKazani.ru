sudo yum -y install supervisor
sudo touch /var/run/supervisor.sock
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/supervisor.sock
sudo service supervisor restart

# 1. create the config file, see below for content
vi /etc/supervisor/conf.d/laravel-worker.conf

# 2. Reload the daemon's configuration files
supervisorctl reread
> laravel-worker: available

# 3. Reload config and add/remove as necessary
supervisorctl update
> laravel-worker: added process group

# 4. Start all processes of the group "laravel-worker"
supervisorctl start laravel-worker:*

# 5. Get status for all processes of the group "laravel-worker"
supervisorctl status laravel-worker:*
> laravel-worker:laravel-worker_00   RUNNING   pid 23758, uptime 0:00:16
> laravel-worker:laravel-worker_01   RUNNING   pid 23759, uptime 0:00:16

# 6. After a change in php sources you have to restart the queue, since queue:work does run as daemon
php artisan queue:restart
> Broadcasting queue restart signal.
